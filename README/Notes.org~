*** Things i am doing per day


*** Modifications on the code

** Change 17:16 did that [2/2]
   - [X] Assigning the viscous term on the res_y into zero   
   - [X] changed back


** Change 17:36 did that [2/2]
   - [X] Assigning the convective term on the res_y into zero   
   - [X] changed back
     
* OUTCOME
- The convective terms are  introducing an instability to my code.
- I need to read the paper regarding the projection methods because i think is
  necessary to introduce e boundary condition for the u tilda
