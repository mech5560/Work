		 /// Code Information ///
This code uses the new versions of my functions where they are  split
into smaller functions and  header files are used.


		 /// Compilation Information ///
It develops the velocity profile for a constant pressure gradient but it does
not work with the O2 optimization flag. It works with O1 and all the O2 flags
though. 



				/// Result Information /// 
This code is able to develop a parabolic velocity profile for constant pressure
gradient flow.


				 /// Objectives ///

I wonna check if this code is capable of adjusting the non-uniform grid while
maintaining the parabolic profile
