***** Things i am doing per day

**** 26/05
*** Modifications on the code 

** Change 17:16 did that [2/2]
   - [X] Assigning the viscous term on the res_y into zero   
   - [X] changed back

** Change 17:36 did that [2/2]
   - [X] Assigning the convective term on the res_y into zero   
   - [X] changed back
     
*** OUTCOME
- The convective terms are  introducing an instability to my code.
- I need to read the paper regarding the projection methods because i think is
  necessary to introduce e boundary condition for the u tilda  
  



**** 27/06

*** General changes in the code
- [ ] I modified the code in order to have constant density, I should   
 change that when I ll apply the code into the general problem

*** Modifications on the code

** 13:56 
- [ ] I introduced the p^{n-1} at the u_tildas.
- [ ] I need to initialize the pressure correctly now in order for the
  streamwise gradients to be absorbed.
* Outcome 

** After lunch, I ll print the dv/dy in order to check that it is zero at the boundaries
